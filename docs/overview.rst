Why SymbolFit?
==============

Whenever you need to find smooth, closed-form functions to model a dataset, whether it consists of scattered data points or a binned histogram, SymbolFit automates the entire process for you!

Traditionally, parametric modeling methods have been empirical, requiring an exact functional form to be fixed before fitting.
For example, if the data follows a simple trend, polynomial regression might be sufficient; if the distribution has a peak followed by a long tail, a combination of a Gaussian and an exponential might barely work.
But what if the data is more complex, and simple function templates fail to fit adequately, leaving you no clue how to construct a suitable functional form?
The only option has been to manually create a complex function and test it through a trial-and-error process, which can take hundreds of iterations.

In most real-world scenarios, distribution shapes are arbitrary, and no true underlying function exists that can be derived from first principles.
This often results in an empirical process: manually guess a functional form, attempt to fit, and if the fit is poor, go back to hand-crafting another candidate, repeating until an acceptable function is found.

Moreover, the functional form that works for one dataset is often tailored specifically to it and may not generalize well to another dataset, even if they share a similar shape, requiring the same empirical and time-consuming effort for each new case.
Examples of this inefficiency can be seen in various recent new physics search analyses at the CERN Large Hadron Collider, such as `dijet <https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.03947>`_, `trijet <https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14023>`_, `paired-dijet <https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.09997>`_, `diphoton <https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09320>`_, and `dimuon <https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08708>`_, and, surprisingly, in the analyses that led to the Higgs boson discovery in 2012 by `ATLAS <https://arxiv.org/abs/1207.7214>`_ and `CMS <https://arxiv.org/abs/1207.7235>`_!

This approach is highly inefficient.

Fortunately, symbolic regression, a powerful machine learning technique, can address this and has the potential to transform the approach to parametric modeling.

Symbolic regression
-------------------

Essentially, symbolic regression is a method that searches for functions to fit data without requiring a predefined functional form.
Instead, symbolic regression constructs and evolves functions throughout the fitting process, with functional forms dynamically changing until the best ones are identified by minimizing a given loss function.

A common approach to symbolic regression is genetic programming, where a function is represented as an expression tree.
New functions are born through node mutation and subtree crossover, as illustrated in the figure below.

In symbolic regression, the function space is defined through allowed operators and function constraints.
This approach does not require prior or extensive knowledge of the final functional forms that can fit the data, as the function search is handled by the machine.

SymbolFit API
-------------
The SymbolFit API is developed to automate parametric modeling using symbolic regression.
The framework is illustrated in the schematic sketch below.

First, it interfaces with `PySR <https://github.com/MilesCranmer/PySR>`_, a high-performance symbolic regression library, to perform an initial machine search for suitable functional forms that fit the data.
Due to the nature of genetic programming, PySR returns a batch of functions per fit.
These initial candidate functions are exact functions without uncertainty modeling, as symbolic regression algorithms focus on finding functional forms and do not inherently estimate uncertainty.
However, describing uncertainty when modeling data is crucial, especially in physics modeling for high-energy physics experiments, as it indicates the reliability of the modelâ€™s representation of observed data.
Moreover, numerical constants in these initial candidate functions may not be highly optimized and can be further improved.

To address this, SymbolFit reprocesses these initial functions and parameterizes them for re-optimization.
First, all numerical constants in each initial function are identified and parameterized.
SymbolFit then parses these parameterized functions and interfaces with `LMFIT <https://github.com/lmfit/lmfit-py>`_, a nonlinear least-squares minimization library, to re-optimize the parameters while keeping the original functional forms fixed.
After re-optimization, the best-fit parameters are refined and come with associated uncertainty estimates.
The combined uncertainty in the parameters is then used as the uncertainty of the candidate function.

SymbolFit chains all these steps together and performs evaluations in one go.
The outputs include essential statistical elements for each candidate function, which are automatically saved and plotted in easily readable formats (CSV tables and PDF plots), making them ready for downstream tasks.

An example
----------
Below is an example demonstrating that a single run of SymbolFit generates a variety of candidate functions, illustrating the convergence from less complex to more complex functions that can effectively fit a nontrivial distribution shape.
