An API to automate parametric modeling with symbolic regression, originally developed for data analysis in the experimental high-energy physics community, but also applicable beyond.

SymbolFit takes binned data with measurement/systematic uncertainties (optional) as input, utilizes `PySR <https://github.com/MilesCranmer/PySR>`_ to perform a machine-search for batches of functional forms that model the data, parameterizes these functions, and utilizes `LMFIT <https://github.com/lmfit/lmfit-py>`_ to re-optimize the functions and provide uncertainty estimation, all in one go.
It is designed to maximize automation with minimal human input. Each run produces a batch of functions with uncertainty estimation, which are evaluated, saved, and plotted automatically into readable output files, ready for downstream tasks.
