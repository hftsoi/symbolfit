Monotonic functions
-------------------

When the dataset presents an obvious strictly increasing or decreasing trend in distribution shape, although symbolic regression algorithms are typically smart enough to return monotonic functions in most cases, but one can still force a such behavior in the fit configuration by penalizing the second derivative in the loss function.

   stay tuned!
